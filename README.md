This project is aimed at classifying images of concrete that either have or don't have cracks on it. The classification is done with a pre-trained ResNet18 Deep Neural Network with PyTorch. The model was trained in 1 epoch with batches of data that include 100 images each. As you can see in the end 5 misclassified and 5 correctly classified images were plotted to give an idea of the model's functioning. The state of the model is saved in 'my_resnet18_classifier_dict_state' file. You can also find the loss plot in the repository.
